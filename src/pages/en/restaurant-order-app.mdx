We have taken special care to make ordering in the app as easy as possible with as few inputs and clicks as possible. When ordering from the table, we do not require an email address or phone number. When it comes to payment, we only ask for the most necessary information.

## Ordering in the restaurant

In your restaurant, new guests also order from time to time. They should be able to browse your offer and order something with the app without explanation. Accordingly, we have made ordering in the app as simple as possible. At the same time, it is also important to present your offer in the best light. That's why we pay attention to a first-class presentation of your food and drinks.

## Ordering with the app

Ordering with the restaurant ordering app is very simple.

- Scan the QR code on the table with your personal cell phone.
- Select the dishes you want to order. <svg style="height: 1em; width: 1em; stroke: var(--primary-color); stroke-width: 4;" viewBox="0 0 24 24"> <path d="M 2,12 L 22,12 M 12,2 L 12,22" /> </svg>
- Open and check the order.
- Submit the order.

If you offer dishes or drinks in different versions, your guests have the possibility to define exactly in which version they want to order the items. If you need to know something mandatory from the guests (such as the cooking level for a steak), the app will prompt them to select the desired option.

## Paying with the app

Depending on how the app is configured, guests pay each time they place an order or only before they leave the restaurant. In either case, payment is simple.

- Confirm amount
- Select payment method.
- Confirm payment.

At the end of the payment in the app, guests can download the receipt.
