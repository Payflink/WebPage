With our innovative web application, beaches can provide their visitors with a convenient takeaway experience by offering digital ordering through a menu accessed via a QR code.

# Easy Ordering via Digital Menu
Thanks to Payflink, your customers can simply use their smartphones to scan the QR code on the digital menu at the beach. This grants them immediate access to the full menu and enables them to place their orders conveniently and contactlessly.
