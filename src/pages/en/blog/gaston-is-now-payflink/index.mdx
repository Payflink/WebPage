Gaston will experience the next push in next year. With Payflink.com GmbH, a company was founded to distribute the ordering app. This puts us in a position to actively approach more restaurants and ensure the success of the product. Accordingly, Gaston is now called Payflink.

For our existing customers, almost everything remains the same. The costs will remain the same for our existing customers for the foreseeable future. In addition, the same people will continue to be responsible for the development of the product. Also your contact persons remain the same. What will not remain the same are our services. The services will be better. Payflink.com GmbH will support restaurants even more actively in using the ordering app.

As part of this change, the team will become larger. Sales and support will thus be taken over by dedicated persons. This will help us grow even faster and prepares us for the future.

The whole team is incredibly excited about the time ahead. With Payflink we are now positioned to optimally support our (future) customers. 2023 here we come!
