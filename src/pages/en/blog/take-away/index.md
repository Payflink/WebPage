Restaurants were hit hard by the Corona crisis. With the lockdown, from one moment to the next, all sales collapsed. Even if the operation of the restaurants will be allowed again, sensitive restrictions will certainly remain for a longer period of time.

So, it takes creativity and new ways to get back to the turnover before the crisis. It remains important to observe the protective measures for guests and staff. We have thought about how we can support the businesses in this.

## Take Away and Home Delivery

Some have already adopted this variant. This quickly opens up new sales channels. Some restaurants update their homepage with the offer and the telephone number. Others simply put a notice board on the street.

These are quick and pragmatic measures that also work. But they can still be optimized in at least two respects:

- With a well-managed order process on the homepage, more customers can be reached. Ordering becomes easier.
- For larger volumes, the process from ordering, payment to delivery must be better organized.

## What is the solution?

We attach great importance to the fact that our solution is implemented quickly and cost-effectively. Therefore, there are only the following steps for restaurant operators to take:

1. [Register free of charge.](/en/prices/)
2. Enter your menu online
3. Include the menu on your homepage (a link is sufficient)

Of course, you can influence the ordering process with some settings:

- Define your opening hours
- Tell us how much lead time you need
- Determine the delivery surcharge

## What's it gonna cost me?

More about the costs of Gaston you can find on the [offer](/en/prices/) page.
