## History

In 2016 Philip was sitting at a table and wanted to pay for his coffee. When he was still not served after 20 minutes, the wheels in his head began to turn. With the ideas of his development team, the first prototype was created in the months that followed.

Our vision has already been realized in a number of restaurants. Now we want to be able to order and pay in more restaurants without waiting.

## Vision

No guest waits to order or pay.

## Mission

Payflink makes it possible to order and pay via app in most restaurants.

## Values

We value respect and honesty. At the same time, we maintain clear communication between ourselves and our customers, partners, users and community.
